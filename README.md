Hello. We are <b>Team Moose</b>.

![Alt text](/resources/TeamMoose.jpg?raw=true "TeamMoose")

<b><i>Who are we?</b></i>

Team Moose is a build team, dev team, and event team. There are 
different people for each division of the team. A list of the people
on the team and what division they are in is below.

<i><b>What do we do?</b></i>

One thing we do is come up with minigame ideas. After the idea is complete,
we make a map for the minigame. With the map being built, the dev division of
TM works on a plugin for the minigame. If we feel that the game might be
successful we might host an event for it. The event is put together and managed by 
the event division of TM.

<i><b>Our goal...</b></i>

Our goal is to one day get one of our minigames or even just a map
built by our team onto the [Hypixel](http://www.hypixel.net) network. Another goal
of ours is to have a successful event for one of our minigames and have the people
playing it enjoy it and have fun.
